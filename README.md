# Math Battler

Oarfish Tech Math Battler. Solve math problems and fight monsters.

You will Unity version 2021.2.0b10. 
I generally wouldn't reccoment rolling building edge, but this version of Unity has the new UIBuilder and UIToolkit fully integrated. 
The UIBuilder makes UI design significantly more simpler and easier to reuse across. 
The UIBuilder will also be the new intended way to build UIs, making it worth the time to learn over the original UI tools.

VSCode is the intended IDE, with the Unity Debugger extension. 

You should be able to clone this repo, import the project in Unity Hub and open it.
